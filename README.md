# metadata-matching

##OVERVIEW
Carnegie Hall Archives maintains a series of small, portable scripts for matching performance data to files. Expediting batch description procedures on our Digital Collections allows us to work quickly and with accuracy.

These scripts have benefitted immensely from a wide community of archiving, preservation, and programming experts who share their code and troubleshooting techniques online. We are excited by the opportunity to participate in this community and have our methods improve through open collaboration and mutual exchange.
